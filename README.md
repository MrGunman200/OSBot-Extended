# OSBot-Extended

Expansion onto OSBot's API

# Extra

Full version of Extended. Consider this version to 
require an overhaul of your script to integrate it.


# Play Ground

Lite version of Extra with the intent on being the 
easiest to implement. This version should require
minor/no tweaks to use. Mostly for smoother/forcing integration
of invokes into scripts.
